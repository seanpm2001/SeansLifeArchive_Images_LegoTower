# Lego Tower session April 29th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a long time, doing a lot of collection, elevator trips, vehicle collection, and piece collection. Todays session was normal, but I was pretty distracted during it. Today, the Pizza scooter vehicle arrived and awarded me over 28000 coins, it was the 1 vehicle that refused to come back for a few sessions. I liked it being stocked up.
