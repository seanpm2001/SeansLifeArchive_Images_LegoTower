# Lego Tower session April 15th 2021

I played for a brief period today and made some progress. I built a new floor, collected from vehicles, got some new pieces, collected and restocked, and did elevator trips.

## New floor

I started construction on my 19th floor today. To follow the pattern of floor types, this floor was a retail floor. The next floor (20) will be a residential floor (unless I make an error)

## Overview

See above.
