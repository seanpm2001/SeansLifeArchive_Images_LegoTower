# Lego Tower session April 8th 2021

I had a short session today with the usual collection.

## Production

I made some stock on all business floors.

## Pieces

I collected several pieces today, of which few of them were new.

## Elevator trips

I made many elevator trips today, as usual.

## Vehicle bonus

My vehicles have been slow to come by. This has opened up the opportunity to collect over 10000 coins from a single vehicle visit. I enjoy the high payout I get from the extra vehicle wait.

## Residential

2 new residents moved into my tower today on floor 18.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.
