# Lego Tower session June 17th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a decent amount of time, doing some collection, elevator trips, and piece collection. I quit after restocking 2 of 3 of every floor. I began construction on a 22nd floor today, and was very slow on completing the 2 objectives, as the game seemed to just not want to help at all with it.
