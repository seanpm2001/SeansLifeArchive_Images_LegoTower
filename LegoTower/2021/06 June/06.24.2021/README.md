# Lego Tower session June 24th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a decent amount of time, doing some collection, elevator trips, and piece collection. I quit after restocking 2 of 3 of every floor. I moved in 3 new residents today, and wasn't able to build any new floors.

## Overview

See above.
