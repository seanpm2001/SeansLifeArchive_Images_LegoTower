# Lego Tower session July 8th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a decent amount of time, doing some collection, elevator trips, and piece collection. I quit after restocking 2 of 3 of every floor. I didn't move in any new residents today and started construction on a new floor (floor 23: service) <!-- didn't build any new floors. !--> I have stopped auto-restocking, and now do it manually to save up a small amount of additional coins weekly.

## Overview

See above.
