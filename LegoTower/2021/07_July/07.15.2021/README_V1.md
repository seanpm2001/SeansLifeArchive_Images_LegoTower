# Lego Tower session July 15th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a decent amount of time, doing some collection, elevator trips, and piece collection. I quit after restocking 2 of 3 of every floor, except for floor 23, which finished building today. It is a laundromat floor. I moved in 1 new resident today. I have stopped auto-restocking, and now do it manually to save up a small amount of additional coins weekly.

## Overview

See above.
