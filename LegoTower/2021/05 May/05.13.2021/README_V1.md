# Lego Tower session May 13th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a very long time, doing a lot of collection, elevator trips, vehicle collection, and piece collection. I collected many new rare pieces today, and did near 100 elevator trips. I also customized my tower a bit, and discovered how to change backgrounds.

## Overview
