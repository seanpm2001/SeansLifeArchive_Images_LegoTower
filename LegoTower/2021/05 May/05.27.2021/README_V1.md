# Lego Tower session May 27th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a decent amount of time, doing some collection, elevator trips, and piece collection. My session was cut in half due to a doctors appointment, and due to a busy schedule today, I quit early. Also, because the game lags really bad when you minimize it, and I didn't want to re-open it, as I felt I made enough progress.

## Overview
